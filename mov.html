        <p class="man">In Thalapathi (1991), Rajinikanth plays Surya, a righteous but hot-headed man raised in poverty,
            who becomes the right-hand man of a local don (played by Mammootty).

            Director: Mani Ratnam

            Music: Ilaiyaraaja

            Genre: Action drama with themes of friendship, loyalty, and moral conflict.

            Notable: The film is loosely inspired by the friendship between Karna and Duryodhana from the Mahabharata.

            Rajini’s character highlights:

            Surya is fierce in his sense of justice, even outside the law.

            His loyalty to Devaraj (Mammootty) drives most of the story.

            The performance was praised for blending Rajinikanth’s charisma with emotional depth.

            If you want, I can also give you five iconic dialogues of Rajinikanth from Thalapathi. Would you like that?
