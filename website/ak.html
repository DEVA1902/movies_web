    <h1> 🎬 Mankatha (2011) – Full Movie Explanation</h1>
   
<h2>1. Intro – Police & Criminals</h2>

<h3>The movie opens with Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Prithviraj investigating a massive illegal cricket betting network in Mumbai. The betting mafia, run by Arumuga Chettiyar, handles crores of black money.
    At the same time, a group of youngsters — Sumanth, Ganesh, Mahat, and Prem — plan to rob ₹500 crores of betting money being transported by Chettiyar’s gang.
</h3>

<h2>2. Vinayak Mahadevan Enters</h2>
<h3>We meet Vinayak Mahadevan (Ajith Kumar) — a suspended police officer. He is stylish, arrogant, witty, and completely selfish.</h3>

<h3>He doesn’t care about morals or friendship.</h3>

<h3>He’s suspended for misusing his power but still has contacts in the police.</h3>
<h3>He meets Trisha (his girlfriend), daughter of a police commissioner.</h3>
<h3>By chance, Vinayak comes across the youngsters’ plan to loot the betting money. Seeing a golden opportunity, he forces himself into the gang.</h3>

<h2>3. The Big Heist</h2>
<h3>The group carefully executes the heist. They successfully steal ₹500 crores meant for Chettiyar. But the gang now faces the real problem — how to share the money and escape.

Vinayak, being much more cunning, manipulates the group. He promises them equal share, but in his mind, he wants everything for himself.
</h3>



<h2>4. Betrayal Begins</h2>
<h3>After the robbery, Vinayak double-crosses the team:

He kills Prem.

He traps Sumanth and Ganesh in dangerous situations.

He cleverly hides the money in a van and pretends like it’s lost.

The gang members start turning against each other, not realizing Vinayak is pulling the strings.
</h3>

<h2>5. ACP Prithviraj on the Hunt</h2>

<h3>Meanwhile, ACP Prithviraj is hot on their trail. He slowly discovers that a police insider is involved. He suspects Vinayak, but since Vinayak is smart and manipulative, he evades capture multiple times.</h3>

<h2>6. Cat & Mouse Game</h2>
<h3>The second half is a rollercoaster of:
    Vinayak killing one teammate after another.

Double-crossing Chettiyar’s men.

Outsmarting the police at every turn.

Every time you think Vinayak is trapped, he plays a new trick to escape.

</h3>
<h2>7. Final Twist</h2>
<h3>In the climax, when the dust settles:

Vinayak manages to get hold of the entire ₹500 crores.

But just as he celebrates, ACP Prithviraj corners him.

In a shocking twist, Prithviraj shoots Vinayak.

Vinayak dies with his trademark devilish smile, proving he remained unapologetically selfish till the very end.
