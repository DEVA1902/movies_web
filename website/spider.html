    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Strange cass the spell. Everyone forgets Peter Parker completely, including MJ and Ned.</h3>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Ending</h2>
<h3>Peter visits MJ and Ned but doesn’t reveal his identity, letting them live safe lives.

He makes a new suit and continues as Spider-Man, completely alone but stronger.</h3>
