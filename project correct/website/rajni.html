    <h1>  ðŸŽ¬ Thalapathi (1991) â€“ Full Story Explanation</h1>
    <h2>1. Birth & Abandonment</h2>
  <h3>The movie begins with Kalyani, a young unmarried woman, giving birth to a baby boy. Out of fear of social stigma, she abandons the child in a goods train wrapped in a yellow cloth. The infant is carried away and finally found by poor people in a slum. They raise him and name him Surya.</h3>

<h2>2. Suryaâ€™s Childhood & Anger</h2>
<h3>Surya grows up in poverty but with a strong sense of justice. He has a hot temper, especially when he sees injustice against the poor. His fighting spirit and kindness make him both feared and respected in the slum. However, he never knows who his real mother is.</h3>

<h2>3. First Killing & Meeting Devaraj</h2>
<h3>One day, Surya kills a local rowdy who was harassing a woman. That rowdy turns out to be the henchman of Devaraj, a powerful gangster but one who is fair to the poor. Instead of seeking revenge, Devaraj admires Suryaâ€™s courage.

He frees Surya from police custody and befriends him. From that moment, Surya becomes Devarajâ€™s most trusted right-hand man (Thalapathi).
</h3>
<h2>4. Suryaâ€“Devaraj Bond</h2>
<h3>Surya and Devaraj build a strong partnership. Together, they run a parallel system of justice, helping the poor and punishing oppressors. The slum people start seeing them as their saviors.
Their bond is very deep â€“ like brothers. Surya finds in Devaraj the family he never had.
</h3>
<h2>5. Arrival of the Collector</h2>
<h3>Enter Arjun, a newly appointed District Collector. He is honest, idealistic, and determined to eliminate crime. His biggest mission is to stop Devaraj and Suryaâ€™s gang activities, which he considers lawless â€“ even though they help the poor.</h3>
<h2>6. Kalyaniâ€™s Return & Shocking Truth</h2>
<h3>Meanwhile, Suryaâ€™s biological mother Kalyani returns to the city with her family. She is now a respectable woman with another son â€” Arjun, the Collector.
This is the shocking twist: Arjun and Surya are brothers, but they donâ€™t know it yet.

One day, when Kalyani sees Surya wearing the yellow cloth she abandoned him in, she realizes he is her lost son. She is filled with guilt but cannot openly accept him, fearing her familyâ€™s reputation.
</h3>
<h2>7. Surya Learns the Truth</h2>
<h3>Eventually, Surya also learns that Collector Arjun is his younger brother. This tears him apart because Arjun is fighting against Devaraj, whom Surya loves like a brother.
Surya is stuck between blood brotherhood (Arjun) and chosen brotherhood (Devaraj).
</h3>

<h2>8. The Conflict</h2>

<h3>Arjun orders police action against Devaraj. There are tense confrontations between Arjun and Surya. At one point, Surya tries to surrender and walk away from violence for the sake of his mother and brother, but fate keeps dragging him back.
    Devaraj too, knowing the truth, doesnâ€™t want to break Suryaâ€™s family bond but refuses to give up his war against corrupt politicians.
</h3>



<h2>9. Tragedy Strikes</h2>

<h3>
    Corrupt rivals plot against Devaraj. In a violent encounter, Devaraj is killed. His death devastates Surya. The friendship that mirrored the Mahabharata bond of Karna and Duryodhana ends in tragedy.
</h3>

<h2>10. Resolution</h2>

<h3>After Devarajâ€™s death, Surya fulfills his friendâ€™s last wishes by taking care of the people they both protected. He silently sacrifices his personal happiness and family bond, living as the guardian of the poor.

Kalyani regrets abandoning him, but Surya accepts his fate like Karna of the Mahabharata â€” noble, selfless, and tragic.</h3>
